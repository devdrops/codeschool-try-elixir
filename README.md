# Code School Try Elixir Course

These are my practices from the exercises of the recently released [Try Elixir](http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/try-elixir) course.

To run all the exercises, I'm using Docker's [elixir](https://hub.docker.com/_/elixir/) official image :shipit:

```
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/test -w /test elixir elixir path/to/my/file.exs
```
